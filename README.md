### Virtual Environment

Setting up a virtual environment is crucial for isolating dependencies and ensuring that your application runs in a consistent environment.

1. **Install `virtualenv`** (if you don't have it already):

    ```sh
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:

    ```sh
    virtualenv venv
    ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    - On Windows:
        ```sh
        venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - On macOS and Linux:
        ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

### Installing Dependencies

Once your virtual environment is activated, you can install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.

1. **Install dependencies**:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

After setting up your virtual environment and installing dependencies, you can run the application.

1. **Run the application**:

    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

Replace `app.py` with the entry point of your web application.
